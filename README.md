**Hey there!** ðŸ‘‹ 

I study physics at [@unmsm](https://unmsm.edu.pe/) and I'm into earthquakes. I code a lot too - mostly JS and Python, but I've been messing around with TypeScript lately. I've got a thing for building and [designing](https://www.behance.net/totallynotdavid) stuff.

Recently, I've been playing with APIs to make things run on their own. Check out some of my work like [gdrivevault](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gdrivevault), [yt_metadata](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yt_metadata) and [totallynotdavid/downloader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@totallynodavid/downloader).
