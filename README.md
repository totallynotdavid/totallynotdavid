Hello there! I'm a physics student with a passion for coding. I love working with Fortran and Python to develop small programs that better help me understand the laws of physics.

As a member of the [CAE-FÃ­sica](https://caefisica.com/) group, I've been lucky enough to collaborate with a bunch of like-minded physics students on a series of study guides for each course of the physics curriculum of the [UNMSM](https://unmsm.edu.pe/). 

Whether I'm working on a study guide or coding up a new program, I'm always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what's possible with physics and technology. So if you're a fellow physics student or coder, don't hesitate to reach out and join me on this exciting journey. Let's learn and grow together!
