**Hello there** <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" height="25px">

I'm a senior physics undergraduate at [UNMSM](https://unmsm.edu.pe/), pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Physics. My primary research interests include seismology and computational methods. In addition to my academic pursuits, I've been learning front-end development and building projects that combine my love for physics with my interest in programming.
